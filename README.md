# Developing best practices for semi-automatic single-cell data annotation

**Single-cell sequencing** is paving the way for precision medicine. It is the next step towards making precision medicine more accurate. One of the most important step in single-cell data analysis is **cell type labeling**. This is a very time-consuming process, the automation of which is a task of current interest.

The goal of this project is using modern machine learning approaches to build semi-automatic single-cell data annotation tool.
